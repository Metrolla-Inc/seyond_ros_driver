## [v1.0.8-dual] (unreleased)

### Changed
- Updated the submodule seyond_sdk from v3.103.4 to release-3.103.13.
- Synced the fork with upstream Seyond-Inc/seyond_ros_driver main (4 commits),
  bringing v1.0.4pre. The significant item for the Bellagio deliver-stage drops is
  "Added async publish thread to decouple pointcloud publishing from data callback" --
  the blocking data-callback publish is the mechanism behind the measured 465-725 ms
  stalls that overflow the SDK deliver queue.

### Fixed (from upstream seyond_sdk 3.103.4 -> 3.103.13)
- Memory corruption in `InnoLidarClient`: `inputParam_` was left uncopied on the
  client-param path; UDP port/IP negotiation reworked with a retry round and
  explicit validation (`get_set_udp_ports_ip`) instead of the old inline item list.
- `stage_client_deliver`: new `disable_do_crc` config key, allowing the per-packet
  CRC to be skipped in the deliver stage.
- `stage_client_read.cpp` substantially reworked (-81 lines) on the read path.
- `robin_nps_adjustment.h` updated (Robin-family NPS adjustment).
- UDP listener now logs the kernel's effective SO_RCVBUF at bind time
  (observability only - it reports the buffer, it does not enlarge it).
- `resource_stats` accounting updated.

### Added (upstream, not used by this fleet)
- Support for hd1-w and E2; HB fault table; HD IMU recording in get_pcd.
